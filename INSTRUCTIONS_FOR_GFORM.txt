IMPORTANT: You MUST also set up a Trigger for the emails to work automatically!

1. Go back to your Script Editor (https://script.google.com/).
2. Paste the code from `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_CODE.js` into the editor.
3. **CRITICAL**: 
   - Get your Brevo API Key from https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api
   - Replace `YOUR_BREVO_API_KEY_HERE` in the code with your actual key.
   - Replace `techathonx@example.com` with your verified sender email in Brevo.

4. Click the `Clock Icon` (Triggers) on the left sidebar.
5. Click `+ Add Trigger` (bottom right blue button).
6. Configure these settings:
   - Choose which function to run: `onFormSubmit` (NOT `doGet`)
   - Select event source: `From spreadsheet`
   - Select event type: `On form submit`
7. Click Save. It will ask for permissions again -> Allow it.

ADMIN QR SCAN:
- The script now supports searching by Team ID.
- Your admin app can fetch details using: `YOUR_SCRIPT_URL?action=get_team&id=TX-26001`
- The QR code in the emails and ID cards contains the Team ID.

CHECKING EMAILS:
- If you have existing rows that didn't get emails, run the function `processAllRows` manually from the script editor to backfill IDs and send emails.
